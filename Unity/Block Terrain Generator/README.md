## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use: Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to get your block terrain up and running in Unity

1. **Copy or Clone the Folder**  
   - Copy the `Block Terrain Generator` folder into your Unity project's `Assets` directory

2. **Create an Empty GameObject**  
   - In your Unity scene, right-click in the Hierarchy and select **Create Empty** 
   - Rename it (for example, `BlockGenerator`)

3. **Add the Script**  
   - Drag the `BlockGenerator.cs` script from your project onto the empty GameObject you just created

4. **Create a Cube Prefab**  
   - In the Project window, right-click and select **Create > 3D Object > Cube**
   - Adjust its size and appearance as desired
   - Drag the cube from the Hierarchy into your Project window to make it a prefab (e.g., name it `BlockPrefab`)
   - Delete the original cube from your scene to keep things tidy

5. **Assign the Prefab to the Script**  
   - Select your `BlockGenerator` GameObject
   - In the Inspector, find the `Block Prefab` field on the script component
   - Drag your `BlockPrefab` prefab into this field

6. **(Optional) Add Decoration Prefabs**  
   - If you want trees or rocks, create prefabs for them and assign them to the `Tree Prefab` and `Rock Prefab` fields

7. **(Optional) Add a Player**  
   - Assign a player prefab to the `Player Prefab` field, or leave it empty for a terrain-only scene

8. **Play!**  
   - Hit the **Play** button in Unity
   - The script will generate a blocky terrain based on your settings
   - Press `R` to generate terrain again
